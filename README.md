# PEPR
## Features
- Explore our stacks directly from your computer,
- Connect to multiple EC2 instances in one go.
## Requirements
- The file `$HOME/.aws/config` must exist and contain the right AWS Access Key ID & AWS Secret Access Key depending on the accounts you need to get access to,
- Report to [this documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) to set it up if necessary.
## Usage
### Availability
pepr is not available on the new jump host, you must install it on your workstation.
Check [that wiki page](https://australiapost.jira.com/wiki/x/cwGgIw) for installation instructions or have a look at the INSTALL file.
### Syntax
| Command | Parameter(s) | Function |

| pepr    | -h / --help  | Display help |

### About the usage of GNU/Screen
pepr uses [GNU/Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) to open multiple SSH connections in multiple terminals while using only one screen. The [manual is available online](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html), but it is unlikely you will ever need to look at it; the few things you have to know are available below.
#### Shortcuts
| Shortcut | Effect |
| -------- | ------ |
| Ctrl + a " | Select a window / virtual terminal |
| Ctrl + a \\ | Quit Screen |
| Ctrl + a S | Horizontally split screen in half |
| Ctrl + a Tab | Switch from one half to another (switch from one region to another) |
## Troubleshooting
### Target platforms
As of now, pepr is running on GNU/Linux and Apple Mac OS X. In the AusPost context, a SSH connection to the DDC Jump box is enough.
### Logfile location
pepr log its actions in `/var/log/messages`
### The number of stacks / instances doesn't match reality
This happens when the query made to AWS took more than 20 seconds to complete; pepr is programmed to react this way in order to avoid wasting your time.
### The instance ID doesn't exist
The full error message is:
```
A client error (InvalidInstanceID.NotFound) occurred when calling the DescribeInstances operation: The instance ID 'i-aabbccdd' does not exist
```
This error occurs when pepr is using outdated cached information. The fix is to delete the cache files:
```
cd /tmp/
rm -fr ./pepr-$(whoami)/
```
